For table dataset1.Dish--

We have data points of the highest and lowest prices for each dish. We thought it would be useful to find the range value 
between these two prices to determine whether certain dishes fluctuate in price more than others (ie, the price of a steak 
might fluctuate a lot more than the price of a piece of gum, candy bar, etc.). To do this, we are going to perform a 
transformation in Beam and re-write a new Dish table with this added data in it.


For table dataset1.Menu2-- 

We have data points of the page count and dish count for each menu. We thought it might be useful to calculate the average 
number of dishes per page to determine how concentrated a particular menu is. To do this, we are using a ParDo function in 
Beam to re-write our Menu table with this metric included.


For table dataset1.Menu_Page-- 

We have data points for the height and width of each menu page. We thought it would be interesting to determine whether each
page was oriented horizontally or vertically. To do this, we are using a ParDo function in Beam to re-write our Menu_Page
table with this information included.
